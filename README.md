# Data Structures and Algorithms 🚀

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms repository! This project is dedicated to exploring fundamental and advanced concepts in data structures and algorithms, helping developers and students strengthen their understanding of computational efficiency.

📖 About This Repository

This repository will serve as a growing collection of:

Explanatory resources (PDFs, notes, and guides)
Code implementations (in various programming languages)
Problem-solving techniques (with real-world examples)
Optimized solutions (analyzing time and space complexity)
Whether you're a beginner looking to get started or an experienced programmer brushing up on skills, this repository aims to provide clear explanations and efficient implementations for a variety of DSA concepts.

📂 Current Contents

1️⃣ TinyPointers PDF
A detailed PDF resource covering key concepts about pointers in programming—essential for understanding memory management, dynamic data structures, and efficient algorithms.

🚀 Upcoming Implementations

🔧 Next Up: Implementation of TinyPointers Concepts
I am currently working on an implementation of TinyPointers.
